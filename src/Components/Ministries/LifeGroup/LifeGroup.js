                            <p>HouseChurch is comprised of 6-7 young adults in small groups. HouseChurch was started as a way to have meaningful conversations about the Bible, prayer, and God. It was also an opportunity to train up new leaders through discipleship. We named the groups HouseChurch because we are still the church outside of Sunday service (even in a house). It was modeled after how the early church would eat, pray, learn, and fellowship together.</p>

We guide them to build a personal relationship with God and to whole-heartily trust, serve and proclaim His name. NLAC Youth gathers weekly to have fun, grow in fellowship and learn biblical lessons to apply in their walk with Jesus.</p>
